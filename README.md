# Description
This site (www.GregRoques.com) is an updated version of my personal Portfolio page created using React and Redux. I chose to recreate my former site, built with vanilla JS and Bootstrap, to allow for cleaner content routing and more dyanmic animation rendering.

# Technologies
- React/Redux
- Node/Express
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Ignored Files
### Front-end – Dependency Folder:
- BackendAPI.js
    - Includes grAPI (to access backend)
    - trackingID (for Google Analytics)

### Back-end – Util Folder
- insta.js (link to access Instagram long term token and token's expiration date)
- linkedInList.js (currated list of Instagram recommendations)
- sendGripApi.js (sendGripApi key ... used to email me when Instagram key has almost expired)
