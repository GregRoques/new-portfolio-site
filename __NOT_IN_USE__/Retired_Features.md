## About

The Instagram Widget is primarily included here in the event that I ever wish to use it again. At the moment, I am no longer passionate about the platform – much less social media in general (particularly Facebook products, of which Instagram is one) – which is why I do not currently have it in use. You can see a demo of how it works below.
